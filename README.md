# hermezon
Hermezon is a service that allows you to notify a phone number either when a product in Amazon becomes available or when its price drops below some target price.


## To Do

- Add a route to get Amazon availability or prices
- Ability to send messages to multipler "messengers": Currently we send messages either to Twilio or to Telegram, but not both.
- Add a "channel" field to set whether we want to use Telegram or Twilio.
- Add tests
